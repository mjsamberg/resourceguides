## Resources and Best Practices
### Videos and Video Chats
Videos and video chats need two primary supports: captions and accessible visuals.

#### Captioning
In addition to benefiting [d/Deaf and hard of hearing users][1], captions can benefit users who are who are in noisy environments, users who get distracted and miss a word, and supports users in taking notes. Captions also have [tremendous value for users with autism, ADHD, Down’s Syndrome, and English Learners][2].

Captions should contain the following elements:
* All spoken words from a video call or presentation
*  Any _relevant_ background noise (i.e. if someone is speaking in a crowded room, the crowd noise doesn’t have to be transcribed **but** if a noise (like a school bell) is relevant and adds value to the video, it should be included in the captions in italics and in square brackets.
* Song lyrics in the background should be included in captions as well.
* Speaker indications. If the person speaking is not the person on the screen in italics and parentheses. 
* It is not necessary to include words that are already on the screen from a slide or visual aid.

Captions can either be human-generated or machine-generated. Human-generated captions are the gold standard as machine-generated captions are prone to error and have trouble transcribing accents and sounds over a video conference or from noisy environments. Human-generated captions, however, are time consuming to create and services to create them can be expensive. Students do have a right to request human-generated transcriptions. In live meetings, you have a few options for generating live captions:
* Human-Captions
	* [Zoom has built-in functionality to type captions in the meeting][4]. A person can be assigned to type captions live in a meeting.
	* Companies exist that will provide this as a service. [NC State has convenience contracts for live captioning][5].
* Machine-Generated Captions
	* [Otter.ai will generate a transcript page for a meeting][6] in Zoom live. The transcript will be in a separate window.
	* [Google Meet has live support for closed captioning][7]. 
	* [Google Slides][8] and [Microsoft PowerPoint][9] have built-in caption support. These captions are limited as they will not display if you switch applications away from the slide deck, and have trouble recognizing other speakers on the Zoom call. Additionally, because they’re embedded in the slide show, they’re “burned in” to the recording and cannot be removed. This may create issues for you later if you want to add human-generated captions to a recording.
	* Using [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)][10], and a website called [WebCaptioner][11], it is possible to [add a caption window to your webcam image][12], and [use this as a camera in Zoom or Google Meet][13]. Like PowerPoint and Google Slides, these captions only recognize the speaker on one computer and are “burned in” to the recording.   

In a pre-made video or a meeting recording,  captions are a bit easier:
* Machine-Generated Captions
