## Legal Requirements for Accessibility
* [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973][1] ([Overview][2])
* [Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973][3]
* [Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act][4]
* [Individuals With Disabilities Education Act][5]

* [Principles of Universal Design](https://projects.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/pubs_p/docs/poster.pdf)

## Universal Design for Learning
[Universal Design for Learning][8], a framework designed by Anne Meyer and David Rose, supports teachers in designing high-quality learning experiences for all learners. While this includes accessible content, it is much more. UDL is designed to support all students, presenting materials in multiple ways, giving students flexibility to interact with the material in the way that works best for them, and provides for different ways for students to express their knowledge. The intent of a UDL classroom is inaccurately summarized as an “IEP for all students”, providing each with the supports and accommodations they need, which can reduce stigma for all students and provide them the tools they need. The core principle of UDL is that “designing for those on the margins improves the experience for all. 

The UDL framework recommends providing multiple means of:
* **Engagement**. Specifically, UDL recommends providing student choice and autonomy in assignments and instructional materials, ensuring that instruction has perceived value and relevance for students and that threats are minimized. UDL also recommends providing options for sustaining student effort including high-salience goals, fostering collaboration and community, and increasing mastery-oriented feedback.
* **Representation**. In addition to providing accessible content, UDL recommends that content is represented in multiple different means (i.e. video, audio, reading, and graphical), that vocabulary is made clear, that multiple media types are used, and that content is framed in the context of both existing background knowledge and generalizability.
* **Action and Expression**. In addition to allowing students the flexibility to express their knowledge in different ways, UDL recommends providing students options for fostering executive functioning including supporting goal setting, planning, information management, and progress monitoring.

### UDL in Virtual Learning
* **Explicitly teach your norms.** Creating consistent structures and then explicitly teaching those structures is critical. This includes explicitly teaching the technology tools that students are supposed to use.
* **Create a routine.** You do not need to schedule every minute of every day, but all students will benefit from consistency and predictability for the daily and weekly routine. This could include being consistent with whole-class synchronous meetings and with due dates.
* **Support executive functioning.** Design clear course layouts in your learning management system with content and deliverables clearly labeled to help students plan. Provide students with checklists for tracking progress and self-check quizzes for helping them monitor their own learning. Provide different options for note-taking. Review [this document from CAST](http://udloncampus.cast.org/page/teach_executive) with additional suggestions.
* **Ensure all content is fully accessible.** While this is required, accessible content benefits all students.
* **Include multiple types of content.** While the [concept of "learning styles" as commonly understood is a myth](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/), providing multiple means of representation for digital content (audio, text, graphics, etc.) can help promote retention by allowing students to choose the one that they prefer and to see content from multiple angles to promote understanding and retention.
* **Use support tools.** Use tools like [Microsoft's Immersive Reader](https://www.onenote.com/learningtools) (or the Unofficial [Chrome Plugin for Immersive Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/use-immersive-reader-on-w/fmidkjgknpkbmninbmklhcgaalfalbdh)) to support student reading and language learning.
* **Provide students with options for engagement.** Students with disabilities, English language learners, and students in very active households may be uncomfortable speaking on camera in synchronous settings. Students may also be uncomfortable showing themselves or their households on camera. Allow students to keep their cameras turned off if they prefer and leverage other ways to engage students synchronously including the chat function and reactions in your video conference platform as well as tools like Padlet and Mentimeter for real-time feedback.
* **Provide students with multiple means of expression.** Allow students to show what they know in different ways. Students can record a video of themselves speaking or create a screencast (instructions for [Chromebook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screencastify-screen-vide/mmeijimgabbpbgpdklnllpncmdofkcpn?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-search)/[Android](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-screen-record-in-android/)/[iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935)/[Windows](https://www.nextofwindows.com/windows-10-screen-recorder)/[Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721)). Let students use a tool on the computer to create an interactive presentation or tool. Allow students to write the essay if they choose to. [Choice boards](https://blog.tcea.org/choice-boards-2/) allow students to select the types of assignments they would like to do.
* **Use groups (or don't).** Some students will crave collaboration and group work. Others will not. Allow students to decide what works best for them based on their preferences and needs.

## Executive Functioning
Executive functioning is described as the "secretary system of the brain". Executive function is the set skills involved to let us set goals, plan, and execute. Executive function is responsible for many skills including attention, organization, planning and prioritizing, starting tasks and remaining on task, understanding points of view, regulating emotion, and keeping track of what you are doing. There are [three major areas of executive functioning](https://www.understood.org/en/learning-thinking-differences/child-learning-disabilities/executive-functioning-issues/what-is-executive-function):

* **Working Memory** - The ability to hold information in your head as you shift between tasks and engage in tasks.
* **Cognitive Flexibility** - The ability to switch between tasks and to examine a task from multiple perspectives.
* **Inhibitory Control** - The ability to control behavior and self-monitor.

Students who struggle with executive functioning issues may sometimes be labeled as having ADHD, as ADHD is a problem with executive functioning. Students who struggle with executive function can sometimes be incorrectly labeled as having a disability. However, executive functioning skills are not innate, and can be taught or supported.

People struggling with executive functioning skills may have trouble starting or working through tasks, have trouble with changing routines or setting goals, have trouble organizing their thoughts, or have difficulty following directions and managing their time.

### Executive Functioning in Virtual Learning Environments

* **Model and reinforce expectations frequently.** Be explicit about what you expect from your students and be consistent. Over-communicate these expectations and ensure that they are documented for a student to refer back to them.
* **Establish a consistent structure within your learning management system.** Use the same general format for your LMS week-by-week. To the extent possible, encourage other teachers to use a similar structure to reduce the variability between classes. Use consistent graphics, symbols, fonts and colors, along with consistent labeling to identify the different readings, assignments, and information in the course.
* **Group content into small, manageable chunks.**
* **Create lists that identify the tasks a student should be working on day-by-day.** A detailed list of the tasks a student should be working on in a week (with approximate times) along with the order that they should be approaching the tasks will help students make a plan and monitor their progress. If students have choices, those choices should be clearly delineated. Make this available for the student to refer to as needed. Consider making it available for students to make their own printed or virtual copy so they can check things off as they go.
* **Clearly identify tasks that are due, due dates, and how assignments should be submitted.** Your Learning Management System may have a calendar function that can handle this. Alternatively, consider using a weekly Google Doc or Word document that each student can copy and annotate as they work through tasks.
* **Provide self-check quizzes with instant feedback so that students may monitor their own progress.** This functionality is built-in to many LMS systems.
* **Check-in with students frequently, both formally in whole-class settings and individually to ensure that students are keeping on-task.**
* **Encourage movement breaks.** [Movement helps improve student productivity and executive functioning skills.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5447760/) Encourage students to get up and move around and take frequent breaks. Consider "standing meetings" where students are standing for part of their asynchronous time or walking check-ins where you call a student while they go for a walk. Each child's movement needs may be different. Encourage choosing movement that is effective for them.
* **Use a timer.** Use a tool such as [TomatoTimer](https://tomato-timer.com/) to encourage students to take breaks. Tomato Timer is built around the [Pomodoro Method](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730) - 25-minute sprints of intense work followed by a 5-minute break and a long break after every 4 sprints. Encourage students to move during these breaks - a brief walk, some stretches, some jumping jacks, or a quick [GoNoodle](https://www.gonoodle.com/).

## Self-Regulation
Self-regulation is not the same thing as self-control. Self-regulation allows people to manage their emotions, behavior, and body movement when they're uncomfortable or stressed. Students who struggle with self-regulation may act impulsively in emotional situations, have a hard time winding down, or experience a "meltdown" when stressed. Kids with sensory processing or executive functioning issues may struggle with self-regulation. Three body-senses contribute to self-regulation, and students who struggle with one or more of these senses may struggle with self-regulation:

* **Interoception:** The interoceptive sense helps you understand what is happening inside your body. This is the sense that tells you when you're hungry or cold. A child who struggles with interoception issues may feel an itch as intense pain, may not know when they are too hot or too cold. These students may also have trouble understanding their emotions, as they cannot understand their body's physical reactions to emotion.
* **Proprioception:** The proprioceptive sense helps you understand how your body moves and the position of your body. A child who struggles with proprioception issues may struggle with coordinating motor movements or crave sensory input, and may struggle with activities that require significant amounts of motor planning such as handwriting or typing. Other students may not register as much proprioceptive input, so they may struggle to sit through a synchronous learning session without sensory input.
* **Vestibular Sense:** The vestibular sense is your body's sense of balance and where your body is in space (spatial orientation). A child who struggles with vestibular sensory issues may want to wobble or appear "clumsy", and may have difficulty looking up at a computer monitor and then down at their paper, or may under-register sensory input and may appear on a synchronous session to be attentive but may be struggling to pay attention.
These three systems work in concert to help self-regulate. While these systems control physical movement in the body, students who are frustrated, tired, or overwhelmed may act-out before they realize their body is out of sorts. Students may lash-out emotionally or physically or can begin to cry or move in a way that's inappropriate.

Students who struggle with executive function or self-regulation may have an IEP which includes occupational therapy provided by the school district or the student may see an occupational therapist privately outside of the school setting.

### Self-Regulation in Virtual Learning Environments
* **Developing executive functioning skills.** A child who is supported in executive functioning is less likely to feel overwhelmed and is, therefore, less likely to have trouble self-regulating.
* **Encourage journaling and logging.** Have students write down the tasks they are working on and what their difficulties are. This will help them advocate and ask for help when they need it instead of feeling overwhelmed. This may require some coaching and modeling from you if students are not familiar with how to journal.
* **Make space.** If feasible, work with families to set up a "work-from-home" space with all of the tools, supplies, and materials that are needed ready to access. Also, encourage the space to be conducive to learning (a chair, minimal distractions, etc.).
* **Encourage music (or not).** For some populations, having music in the background can help students focus. For others, it can be a distraction. Help students figure out which is better for them.
* **Include "activator" activities:** Before class begins, be intentional about transitioning to learning and being mindful of the space. Make a deliberate transition into synchronous learning, and provide ample time for students to switch into "synchronous mode". Consider including a [mindfulness activity](https://www.understood.org/en/friends-feelings/empowering-your-child/self-awareness/mindfulness-kids-who-learn-think-differently).
* **Include an "escape hatch":** For many students, the ability to effectively manage all of the activity happening during a synchronous session (the Zoom boxes, the noises, monitoring your own behavior) can be overwhelming for students. While it is critical to teach students how to minimize distractions (show one camera at a time, select the camera that's displayed, hide the chat, etc.), students may become overwhelmed during synchronous instruction. Create a discreet way for students to signal to you that they need a break and make space for them to leave the session to calm down and return when they are ready.
* **Check-in frequently:** Include phone-calls or emails on a regular basis to check in on students as needed.
* **Encourage movement:** Like with executive function, allowing students to move when they need to can help them self-regulate.
* **Use accessibility tools:** For students who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, remember that students can move through a web page using the tab key, the enter key, and the arrow keys on the keyboard. Students can also use transcription features in [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/4492226?hl=en#:~:text=Open%20a%20document%20in%20Google%20Docs%20with%20a%20Chrome%20browser.&text=Voice%20typing.,to%20speak%2C%20click%20the%20microphone.) and [Microsoft Word](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dictate-text-using-speech-recognition-05725ee2-ae2e-438f-847c-b80e754eb50b) to type using their voice. Also consider allowing students to submit assignments by taking a photo or scan of a written page or a voice/video recording.

## General Accessibility Guidelines
[![Accessibility Guideline Posters via the UK Accessibility Office https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/][image-1]][6]
Remember these accessibility [guidelines from the U.K. Accessibility Office][7], including:
* Use clear language and consistent layouts
* Use bullet points and simple sentences
* Avoid bright, busy layouts
* Use readable font sizes and good contrast
* Don’t bury information in downloads
* Use headings, subheadings, and videos
* Spread interactives out over a document
* Camel case your hashtags on social media to improve readability (#camelCaseCapitalizesTheFirstLetterOfEachWord)

## Videos and Video Chats
Videos and video chats need two primary supports: captions and accessible visuals.

### Captioning
In addition to benefiting [d/Deaf and hard of hearing users][9], captions can benefit users who are who are in noisy environments, users who get distracted and miss a word, and supports users in taking notes. Captions also have [tremendous value for users with autism, ADHD, Down’s Syndrome, and English Learners][10].

Captions should contain the following elements:
* All spoken words from a video call or presentation
*  Any _relevant_ background noise (i.e. if someone is speaking in a crowded room, the crowd noise doesn’t have to be transcribed **but** if a noise (like a school bell) is relevant and adds value to the video, it should be included in the captions in italics and in square brackets.
* Song lyrics in the background should be included in captions as well.
* Speaker indications. If the person speaking is not the person on the screen in italics and parentheses. 
* It is not necessary to include words that are already on the screen from a slide or visual aid. 
* [Video Captioning Style Guide from University of Melbourne][11]

Captions can either be human-generated or machine-generated. Human-generated captions are the gold standard as machine-generated captions are prone to error and have trouble transcribing accents and sounds over a video conference or from noisy environments. Human-generated captions, however, are time consuming to create and services to create them can be expensive. Students do have a right to request human-generated transcriptions. In live meetings, you have a few options for generating live captions:
* Human-Generated Captions
	* [Zoom has built-in functionality to type captions in the meeting][12]. A person can be assigned to type captions live in a meeting.
	* Companies exist that will provide this as a service. [NC State has convenience contracts for live captioning][13].
* Machine-Generated Captions
	* [Otter.ai will generate a transcript page for a meeting][14] in Zoom live. The transcript will be in a separate window.
	* [Google Meet has live support for closed captioning][15]. 
	* [Google Slides][16] and [Microsoft PowerPoint][17] have built-in caption support. These captions are limited as they will not display if you switch applications away from the slide deck, and have trouble recognizing other speakers on the Zoom call. Additionally, because they’re embedded in the slide show, they’re “burned in” to the recording and cannot be removed. This may create issues for you later if you want to add human-generated captions to a recording.
	* Using [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)][18], and a website called [WebCaptioner][19], it is possible to [add a caption window to your webcam image][20], and [use this as a camera in Zoom or Google Meet][21]. Like PowerPoint and Google Slides, these captions only recognize the speaker on one computer and are “burned in” to the recording.   

In a pre-made video or a meeting recording,  captions are a bit easier:
* Machine-Generated Captions
	* [Zoom will automatically create a webpage with captions for cloud recordings, if enabled][22].
	* When uploading a video to YouTube, [YouTube will automatically create captions][23] within a few hours after upload.
* Human-Generated Captions
	* [Rev.com][24] offers a service that will transcribe video and audio files for you. Rev.com can automatically push corrected captions to YouTube. 
	* Automatic [captions in YouTube can be corrected][25] to be more accurate. If a video is kept unlisted or private, you can keep it from being discoverable while enabling these features.

### Accessible Visuals
Keep in mind that the PowerPoints and other materials shared on screen sharing during a Zoom call, or embedded in a video, are not accessible. It’s recommended that you share slide decks with users ahead of time and share the link in the chat so that users can access them. If you share your screen during a presentation, narrate your actions so that someone can recreate them.  If necessary, you may need to [create an audio description track][26] to narrate actions separate from the main video. 

## Fonts
The use of fonts should be kept to a minimum number of easily-readable fonts. 12 point minimum is recommended on documents. 14 point minimum is now recommended on websites, and 18 point font is recommended on slides. Use the [WebAIM contrast checker][27] to ensure that sufficient contrast exists between your text and your background at the font size you are using.

## Images
In presentations, reports, and web pages, images need to be annotated with alternative text (also called an alt-tag) that describes the content of the image. This allows users who can’t access the image (due to a visual impairment, low bandwidth connection, etc.) to understand the contents. Alternative text **must** be used for every image in a document unless the image is purely decorative and serves no functional purpose in the document. Alt text should also describe the _contents_ of the image, and not the image itself. Consider the example below. Using alt-text of “The water cycle” for this image is inadequate because it does not describe the contents of the image. You would need to use a describe tag such as “The water cycle: the process by which water in the oceans evaporates, condenses to form clouds, falls to the ground as rain, and is again collected in the ocean.” The content of an image should also be reflected in a document. For example, a graph can be alt-tagged, but the description of the key findings (and ideally, a data table) should be included in a document. For complicated charts, it is acceptable to reference the discussion section of a paper if the information conveyed there will explain the chart. Alt tags are added differently in different applications. In Moodle, there is an alt-text field when adding an image. In Office and Google Docs, you can right-click on an image to add the alt text. You can also add alt-text on [Twitter][28], [Facebook][29], and [Instagram][30]. 
![Illustration of the water cycle, showing the process by which water in the oceans evaporates, condenses to form clouds, falls to the ground as rain, and is again collected in the ocean.][image-2]

In addition, it is a best practice to avoid images that are all text, and creating these elements as text instead. Consider the example below. Instead of using an HTML table, this school posted an image of their bell schedule. However, because the text is contained within the image, it is unable to be read by screen readers or translation software.
![Sample image containing text that cannot be read by a screen reader.][image-3]

### File Sizes
Images embedded into documents and websites should be no larger than they need to be to maintain the needed level of detail. For example, a smartphone camera will likely take an image that is a 2MB image with dimensions of 14” x 9”. Many smartphone cameras can take much larger, much higher resolution images. These large files can use data from those with limited connections. Keep images to 500KB on websites unless absolutely necessary. 

### Use of Color, Charts and Graphs
In addition to creating accessible images, the use of color in resources creates accessibility issues as well. To support those with color blindness and other visual impairments, foreground and background colors in documents should always be high-contrast. The [WebAIM Contrast Checker][31] can tell you based on the font size if a foreground and background color are high enough contrast. 

In a chart, each visual element should also contrast sufficiently. For example, in a bar graph, each bar should be sufficient contrast from each other bar (see [this guide from Penn State][32]). In addition, color should not be the only indicator of information. For example, labeling your axes, using shedding patters, etc. to differentiate between data points. 

You should use captions to title a figure (in a way that’s tied to the table). In Word [you can right-click on images to add a caption][33] (this functionality is not available in Google Docs). In HTML, use this syntax around your image:

	<figure>
		<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image Alt Text">
		<figcaption>Figure caption</figcaption>
	</figure>

## Headings
Screen readers, table of contents tools, and keyboard navigation use headings to navigate the screen. In addition to using proper heading styling, headings should be _nested_ such that Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 headings, etc. do not appear out of order. Level 2 headings should only appear under level 1 headings, and Level 3 headings should only appear under Level 2 headings. Additionally, it’s recommended that on web pages, there is only one Level 1 heading - the page title. While this isn’t a requirement, there should be at least one level one heading on each page and it generally works out that the page title as a Level 1 Heading and using Level 2 throughout the rest of the page is the easiest approach (as on this page).

## Hyperlinks
Many screen readers will allow users to navigate links on a web page as a list. For users with motor disabilities, an accessible website allows for navigation using only the tab and arrow keys to move between links (and the Enter key to select them). Additionally, to simplify the user experience, links should be descriptive and should help the user figure out where they will be linking to. Avoid making the link the word “here” and avoid using the same words for multiple links in a document. 

For example: 
_Learn more about the [Friday Institute][34] by clicking [here][35], [here][36], and [here][37]._

From this sentence, it’s not clear what users will be learning about when they click on the link. Secondarily, on phone screens, the words “here” are too close together and may not make a large enough tap target for someone with limited dexterity to click on. Instead, word links descriptively, like:
_Learn more about the [Friday Institute][38], [our mission][39], [our projects][40], and [our people][41]. _

Additionally, since some users may not be aware of changes in the active window, it is a best practice to inform users when the link they click on will open in a new tab. Some websites add the text “(opens in a new tab)” to the link text. Others use an icon and [include ARIA tags to inform users that their site will open in a new window][42].

## Tables
Tables with a designated header row and column should have columns designated as such so that screen readers and other format converters will read the header information with the cell data, and so that headers will be shown on each printed page.

In HTML, this is done as follows:

	<table>
		<caption>Table Title</caption> <!--Table Title-->
		<thead> <!--Table Header-->
			<tr> <!--start header row-->
				<th> <!--use th instead of td to designate a table header-->
					Table Header 1
				</th>
				<th>
					Table Header 2
				</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody> <!--Begin the body of the table-->
			<tr>
				<th><!--Use th for a header column-->
					Header Column
				</th>
				<td><!--Use td for table data-->
					Table Data
				</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

In Microsoft Word, [you can designate a table header row][43], as well as add alt text for a table. For Microsoft Excel, you can [create named regions to designate a table][44]. Additionally, you should use captions to title a table so that users know the title of a table (in a way that’s tied to the table). In Word and Google Docs, [you can right-click on tables to add a title][45]. In HTML, use the `<caption>` tag inside your table tag to add a title.

## Microsoft Office and Google Drive
Whether in webpages or in documents, many of the same accessibility rules above apply - images should have alt text, table rows should be labeled, etc. In addition, you should use _semantic styling_ in **all** documents, including Word Docs, Google Docs, and HTML files. Semantic styling involves identifying elements in a document by what they are, rather than how they look. Whereas typically, to designate a header in Google Docs, you might simply bold the text, when styling semantically, you would use the styles pane to designate an element as a header, and then style the header through the styles pane.
* [Using and editing styles in Word][46]
* [Using and editing styles in Google Docs][47]

PowerPoint has a [number of accessibility features][48] (beyond alt text and the other items discussed). Specifically, you’ll want to make sure that you use named regions on your slides (title text, subtitle text, body text, etc.) as intended and set a reading order for your slides to ensure that a screen reader would read items in the correct sequence.

### Accessibility Checking
[Microsoft Office features a built-in accessibility checker][49] across all Office apps. This tool will check accessibility features in your document 

Google Docs does not have a tool like this built in. However, the [Grackle Docs extension][50] does this in Google Docs. 

### Voice Typing and Reading Support Tools
You can type with your voice In both [Google Docs][51] and [Microsoft Office][52] which is helpful for students with motor disabilities. Additionally, Microsoft Word will provide [readability statistics][53], and has a built in reading support tool called [Immersive Reader][54].  

## PDF Files
PDFs are among the most difficult format types to make accessible, especially using Acrobat’s built-in tools. The best practices are to [design in Word, and then export to PDF][55]. Confirm accessibility in Word before exporting. Additionally, it is recommended to make documents available in another format.

Documents that are scanned to PDF are not accessible. The University of Arizona has a good [primer on PDF accessibility][56].  

## Websites and Web-Based Applications
When designing a web page, consider all of the elements above, and use that to create proper, [semantically-styled HTML5][57]. While many built-in editors in content management systems like Moodle and WordPress will do a good job on their own, they may not be perfect and some manual code editing is sometimes (though rarely) required. The [WAVE tool][58] will check accessibility  for a website against the [Web Content Accessibility (WCAG) Guidelines][59]. The current version of WCAG guidelines is version 2.1. WCAG is based on a three-tier system from single-A to triple-A (AAA). WCAG-2.1-A guidelines are the least strict (and the most minimally accessible) while WCAG-2.1-AAA is the most strict. NC State policy requires compliance with [WCAG-2.1-AA][60]. 

One particular element of WCAG-2.1-AA is navigation. For users using assistive or adaptive devices who may not be able to use a mouse, they should be able to navigate a website using only arrow keys (including Page-Up and Page-Down), the tab key to move between links, and the Enter key to select a link.

Commercial web applications using a [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template][61] (VPAT) to indicate their compliance with WCAG or Section 508 standards.
